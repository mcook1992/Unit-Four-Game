Star Wars Test Game

This is a Star Wars RPG game in which the user picks a character and then attempts to fight their way through the remaining three characters. With each attack, the main character's attack power grows stronger. In order to win, the user must pick the opponents in the correct order. If they pick the strongest opponent first, they will lose the game.

This game is primarily built with Javascript and JQuery.
